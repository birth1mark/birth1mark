- My way to the computer science started early. I got my first computer when I was 5. Since that day computers are always in my way, the same way everything that complies with technology. 
Although tehnology is almost in every place, in everything we do I'm a guy that really enjoy's the common things in our lifes, like reading a ''paper book'' or chat with friends.
